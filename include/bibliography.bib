	abstract = {{LaTeX} ( {LAH}-tekh or  {LAY}-tekh) is a document preparation system. When writing, the writer uses plain text as opposed to the formatted text found in {WYSIWYG} ("what you see is what you get") word processors like Microsoft Word, {LibreOffice} Writer and Apple Pages. The writer uses markup tagging conventions to define the general structure of a document (such as article, book, and letter), to stylise text throughout a document (such as bold and italics), and to add citations and cross-references. A {TeX} distribution such as {TeX} Live or {MikTeX} is used to produce an output file (such as {PDF} or {DVI}) suitable for printing or digital distribution. Within the typesetting system, its name is stylised as {LaTeX}.
{LaTeX} is widely used in academia for the communication and publication of scientific documents in many fields, including mathematics, statistics, computer science, engineering, chemistry, physics, economics, linguistics, quantitative psychology, philosophy, and political science. It also has a prominent role in the preparation and publication of books and articles that contain complex multilingual materials, such as Sanskrit and Greek. {LaTeX} uses the {TeX} typesetting program for formatting its output, and is itself written in the {TeX} macro language.
{LaTeX} can be used as a standalone document preparation system, or as an intermediate format. In the latter role, for example, it is sometimes used as part of a pipeline for translating {DocBook} and other {XML}-based formats to {PDF}. The typesetting system offers programmable desktop publishing features and extensive facilities for automating most aspects of typesetting and desktop publishing, including numbering and cross-referencing of tables and figures, chapter and section headings, the inclusion of graphics, page layout, indexing and bibliographies.Like {TeX}, {LaTeX} started as a writing tool for mathematicians and computer scientists, but even from early in its development, it has also been taken up by scholars who needed to write documents that include complex math expressions or non-Latin scripts, such as Arabic, Sanskrit and Chinese.{LaTeX} is intended to provide a high-level, descriptive markup language that accesses the power of {TeX} in an easier way for writers. In essence, {TeX} handles the layout side, while {LaTeX} handles the content side for document processing. {LaTeX} comprises a collection of {TeX} macros and a program to process {LaTeX} documents, and because the plain {TeX} formatting commands are elementary, it provides authors with ready-made commands for formatting and layout requirements such as chapter headings, footnotes, cross-references and bibliographies.
{LaTeX} was originally written in the early 1980s by Leslie Lamport at {SRI} International. The current version is {LaTeX}2e (stylised as {LaTeX}2ε). {LaTeX} is free software and is distributed under the {LaTeX} Project Public License ({LPPL}).},
