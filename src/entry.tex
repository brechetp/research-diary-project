\section*{Training gaussians}

Back to training on gaussians with informative and anti-informative models.

Batch normalization improves the learning in this case as well. As recommended by DCGAN, avoid using batch normalization for the first layer of discriminators.

\paragraph{Bug corrected} Evaluation of the generator must be enclosed withing \texttt{G.eval() ... G.train()} if batch normalization is used in the generator.

\paragraph{Dev} Changed the behavious of Gaussian data generation, used to whiten the data
by dividing by the standard deviation, not anymore. Set the grid following
\cite{Dumoulin2016}.

\paragraph{Tests} Testing the primal anti-informative regularization, the informative regularization (all with Sinkhorn), the InfoGAN model.

\section*{Cropping the CelebA}

\paragraph{Cropped dataset}

The repo of infogan does not provide the CelebA dataset used in the paper
experiments. \\

Moreover, none (?) of the
\href{https://paperswithcode.com/paper/infogan-interpretable-representation-learning}{listed
repositories for InfoGAN} contains the code for the cropped CelebA dataset. Therefore,
the images are cropped following

Update: check ALI \href{https://ishmaelbelghazi.github.io/ALI/} for the CelebA and other dataset (code is available, rely on some libraries) \\

The images are therefore manually cropped to cover a  pixel region
of width 40 pixels and respected ratio 218/178 (original images are 178x218).
Original images are centered around the eyes, cropped images are more centered
around the nose. \\

Images are then rezised to 64x64, and saved in a HDF5 file.

\paragraph{Bug?} There might be a bug in reading (cropped and regular) CelebA from the HDF5 file when using multiple threads. Or it is just displaying images from the file that is not always working.
